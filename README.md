# Yet-another-procedural-generator

I made this procedural generator for science-practical conference in March 2018.  

**Program opportunities:**  
1. Interface is made using WinForms
2. Map settings *like seed and size (if size 8 then cube size is 2^8+1 = 257)*
3. Pseudorandom generator *that depends on two numbers( X,Y )*
4. Moving player (red dot) using
    * arrows ( ↑ ← → ↓ )	
    * text box "Coordinates" and button "Change"
5. MiniMap (increses picture twice on each side)
6. For of war
7. Lazy generating by moving player
8. Generating whole map by clicking seond time button "Generate"
9. Height map, Moisture map and Heat map are combining into climat map that is being displayed in window
